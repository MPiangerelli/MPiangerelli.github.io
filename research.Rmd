### Publications


### Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

At Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center I spent six years collaborating on research projects in genito-urinary cancers, with an emphasis on genetic predictors of patient outcomes. Since then I have worked with the breast surgery service on research comparing patient outcomes according to different treatment strategies. I have also collaborated closely with epidemiologists on research related to smoking and bladder cancer and with health outcomes researchers on long-term outcomes following treatment for lymphoma.
