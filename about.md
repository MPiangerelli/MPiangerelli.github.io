I was born in Battipaglia (SA), Italy in 1984. I got my Bachelor Degree from the [Politecnico of Milano](https://polimi.it) in Bioengineering.
In 2012, I was a visited student at [Cornell University](http://cornell.edu) for working on mathematical modelling of cardiac arrhythmias under the supervision of Prof. [Flavio Fenton](https://thevirtualheart.org/intro.html); I graduated from the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it) with a MS in bioengineering in 2013 with a thesis on the same topic.

I got a PHD in Computer Science at [University of Camerino](https://computerscience.unicam.it) under the supervision of Prof.ssa [Emanuela Merelli](http://www.emanuelamerelli.eu) with a thesis on Topological Data analysis for studying the emergence of epileptic seizures.
During this period I collaborated with an Italian company, [ab medica s.r.l.](http://abmedica.it), for the development of an implantable device for detecting and controlling epiletic seizures.

I worked in the [Da.Re. Project](http://dare-project.eu), an European Erasmus+ project, whose aim was to establish a European Master Degree Curriculm in Data Science. Moreover I partecipated to the [T.R.E.E.](https://opencoesione.gov.it/it/progetti/5ma10458/) project working with Prof. [Renato De Leone](http://www.unicam.it/~renato.deleone).

Currently, I am a post-doc at University of Camerino working with Prof. [Flavio Corradini](https://www.cs.unicam.it/corradini/) on the SIMPLE project.

I am a member of the [Processes and services (Pros) Lab](https://pros.unicam.it) of which Prof Flavio Corradini is the coordinator.

I am, also, a member of the [Bioshape and Data Science Lab](http://www.emanuelamerelli.eu/bigdata/doku.php) coordinated by Prof.ssa Emanuela. 

I live in Portorecanti, Italy.
