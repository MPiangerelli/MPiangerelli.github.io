I was born in Battipaglia (SA), Italy in 1984.
In 2012, I was a visited student at [Cornell University](http://cornell.edu) for working on mathematical modelling of cardiac arrhythmias under the supervision of Prof. [Flavio Fenton]; I graduated from the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it) with a MS in bioengineering in 2013 with a thesis on the same topic.

I got a PHD in Computer Science at [University of Camerino](https://computerscience.unicam.it) under the supervision of Prof.ssa [Emanuela Merelli](http://www.emanuelamerelli.eu) with a thesis on Topological Data analysis for studying the emergence of epileptic seizures.
During this period I collaborated with an Italian company, [ab medica s.r.l.](http://abmedica.it), for the development of an implantable device for detecting and controlling epiletic seizures.

Currently, I am a post-doc at University of Camerino in the Math Division working with Prof. [Renato De Leone](http://www.unicam.it/~renato.deleone) on the T.R.E.E. Project.

I am a member of the [Bioshape and Data Science Lab](http://www.emanuelamerelli.eu/bigdata/doku.php) whose Prof.ssa Emanuela Merelli is coordinator. 

I live in Portorecanti, Italy
