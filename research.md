## University of Camerino
My primary research field is unsupervised learning and data science, particularly in the field of complex systems dynamics.

My application domain mainly concerns the medical and biological field (in my PhD thesis I focused on the study of epilepsy and on the analysis of EEG traces) where I am experimenting with new techniques of data analysis such as Topological Data Analysis (TDA) especially for time series analysis.

I am also interested in more purely educational aspects and I participated in the Erasmus+ [Da.Re](www.dare-project.eu) where a European curriculum was proposed for a master's degree in Data Science.
